This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Custom Home Page
This is a remake of my first project on GitHub! I have learned a lot since that first commit! The idea is simple make this project your Chrome homepage and enjoy!

## [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) 
This project fetches weather from the open weather map api. You will need your own
API key to run this project locally or to host your own instance. You will also want 
to proxy the api requests so as not to expose your key on the front end.
Feel free to host this yourself and add your favorite pictures. 

## API Proxy

I proxied the api requests with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and [node-api-proxy](https://github.com/jesperorb/node-api-proxy)

This prevents exposing the api key on the front-end 

## Open Proxy Problem!!
Ok so setting up the heroku proxy server is better than exposing the api key but now
I have an open proxy

Next step figure out how to restrict the proxy!!

Need to learn more server programming first..

getting full stack is no joke!!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
